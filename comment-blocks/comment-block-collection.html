  Nigerians complain a lot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You get a job and you don't like the offer you quit!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Why trouble yourself with outsource and no outsource after years of sitting at home unemployed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country is bad make do with what you have and make other plans for the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Do you plan on working your entire life for a boss? F**k NO!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Make do with what you have now that you're still young instead of whining like an entitled spoilt brat and chart your way to success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stay here and complain while others are already planning ahead.
  <br/>

  Nigerians complaint too much.

 If you go in as a contractor and prove yourself then you may get picked up.

 As an employer, why would I waste resources to board and then have to fire an employee that didnâ€™t work out.

 Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in
 <br/>
 such a way that will enable pre - primary school pupils to learn software development and coding .
 <br/>
 Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel
 <br/>
 Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
 <br/>
 Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
 <br/>
 Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
 <br/>
 “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
 <br/>
 “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

  Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in

  <br/>
  Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel

  Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
  <br/>
  Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
  <br/>
  “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
  <br/>
  “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

  Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in

  <br/>
  Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel

  <br/>
  Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
  <br/>
  “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
  <br/>
  “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

  Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in
  <br/>
  such a way that will enable pre - primary school pupils to learn software development and coding .
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel
  <br/>
  Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
  <br/>
  Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
  <br/>
  “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
  <br/>
  “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

 Who will be in charge of teaching the students? Is it the present bulk of teachers that majority can't operate computers? Programming that has not been incorporated fully in B.Sc computer science in the university is what these jokers are promising to nursery students. You have not been able to solve power issues, you are talking about programming? Then with some children doing 15 subjects already, you will now add a very dynamic concept like software development.

I thought they say, education is wisdom. Nigerians are in for long things.

  Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in
  <br/>
  such a way that will enable pre - primary school pupils to learn software development and coding .
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel
  <br/>
  Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
  <br/>
  Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
  <br/>
  “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
  <br/>
  “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

  One of the soldiers who escaped the deadly attack on the military formation in Metele in Borno state has narrated how he escaped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 100 soldiers attached to 157 task force battalion were reportedly killed in the attack while the armoury at the formation was looted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) had claimed responsibility for the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier who spoke off the record said more than 100 of his colleagues fled the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier accused the military authorities of lying to the public about the insurgency in the north-east, calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Most of our people dropped their arms and pulled off this dirty uniform… the bodies of our troops littered everywhere but we watched the news and heard army headquarters saying troops repelled the attack,” he told TheCable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The army chief and other generals only sit in Abuja and lie to Nigerians whereas soldiers are being killed on daily basis. We lack manpower but nobody is telling the president the truth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The president should demand the whereabouts of all the soldiers deployed to Operation Last Hold to fight Boko Haram under Major General Abbah Dikko. The answer is, all of them have been crushed by Boko Haram and their new weapons and arms are what the Boko Haram is using to attack us. Please, help us tell Mr President that the service chiefs are just lying to him.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another soldier said he and his colleagues engaged the insurgents in a gun battle for 40 minutes but they eventually ran out of ammunition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said troops at the formation were alerted about the attack, one hour before the insurgents struck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sakaba told us to prepare for battle after being briefed by one of our soldiers whose duty is to monitor what is coming from distance,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We engaged the terrorists for over 40 minutes before we ran out of ammunition on that very Sunday. They were well equipped and armed with rocket propelled grenades, more than 12 gun trucks mounted with anti-air craft shooting at us from a long range,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Some of us ran out of bullets and they overpowered us, we fled but those who could not escape were slaughtered like chicken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My brother our formation is surrounded by big trenches and barbed wires, which became a trap for our made it difficult for them to escape. I watched many of my fellow friends died helplessly in cold blood.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another soldier who wants to be identified at Gods child, said it was a miracle that they survived the onslaught.

 Those weapons bokoharam are using are newly purchased with ransom mone paid by buhari.Nigeria can afford it but the $1billion budget for arms to fight bokoharam whom lie Mohamed said have been technically defeated have been diverted for his second term election campaign.While buratai and his colleague generals have diverted the rest.

  You people are ridiculous. Why don't you go and join the battle. My friend in the military posted to borno told me that the average weapons boko uses is anti aircraft guns. Their range and intensity is superior to the AK47 Nigerian soldiers.
  <br/>
  Until Nigeria starts procuring F-16s and the like capable of giving cover then Nigeria may continue to lose this battle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It might be time for us to call in the US Airforce for assistance in this war.

 in my own opinion, intelligence is better than brute Force and best weapons. The boko haram boys are being fed information which they've been exploiting. They need to seek the moles within them especially their commanders who put them in harm's way

 You don't need much for an ambush.. the power of the ambush lies in the surprise it springs and it's ability distort the battle plan of the enemy ... Even even three well placed snipers and a couple of mines can create a perfect ambush and if the CO knew he didn't have enough ammo to hold fort he should have called for a tactical retreat and moved our T72 out of there instead of leaving it for Boko haram to steal

 Terrorism is big business. If you know, you know.

 Suddenly where did the trucks and weapons of the so called Boko haram come from? So we don't have drones giving us live feed of the North east region?

 The high wired politics, foreign powers too are working in tandem with a few cohorts here to use terrorism as conduit to repatriate funds to the masters. The pawns in the game are the unsuspecting Nigerian soldiers.
