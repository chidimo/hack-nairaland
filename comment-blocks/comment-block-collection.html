  Nigerians complain a lot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You get a job and you don't like the offer you quit!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Why trouble yourself with outsource and no outsource after years of sitting at home unemployed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country is bad make do with what you have and make other plans for the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Do you plan on working your entire life for a boss? F**k NO!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Make do with what you have now that you're still young instead of whining like an entitled spoilt brat and chart your way to success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stay here and complain while others are already planning ahead.
  <br/>

  Nigerians complaint too much.

 If you go in as a contractor and prove yourself then you may get picked up.

 As an employer, why would I waste resources to board and then have to fire an employee that didnâ€™t work out.

 Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in
 <br/>
 such a way that will enable pre - primary school pupils to learn software development and coding .
 <br/>
 Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel
 <br/>
 Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
 <br/>
 Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
 <br/>
 Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
 <br/>
 “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
 <br/>
 “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

  Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in

  <br/>
  Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel

  Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
  <br/>
  Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
  <br/>
  “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
  <br/>
  “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

  Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in

  <br/>
  Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel

  <br/>
  Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
  <br/>
  “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
  <br/>
  “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

  Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in
  <br/>
  such a way that will enable pre - primary school pupils to learn software development and coding .
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel
  <br/>
  Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
  <br/>
  Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
  <br/>
  “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
  <br/>
  “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

 Who will be in charge of teaching the students? Is it the present bulk of teachers that majority can't operate computers? Programming that has not been incorporated fully in B.Sc computer science in the university is what these jokers are promising to nursery students. You have not been able to solve power issues, you are talking about programming? Then with some children doing 15 subjects already, you will now add a very dynamic concept like software development.

I thought they say, education is wisdom. Nigerians are in for long things.

  Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in
  <br/>
  such a way that will enable pre - primary school pupils to learn software development and coding .
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel
  <br/>
  Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
  <br/>
  Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
  <br/>
  “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
  <br/>
  “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

  One of the soldiers who escaped the deadly attack on the military formation in Metele in Borno state has narrated how he escaped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 100 soldiers attached to 157 task force battalion were reportedly killed in the attack while the armoury at the formation was looted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) had claimed responsibility for the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier who spoke off the record said more than 100 of his colleagues fled the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier accused the military authorities of lying to the public about the insurgency in the north-east, calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Most of our people dropped their arms and pulled off this dirty uniform… the bodies of our troops littered everywhere but we watched the news and heard army headquarters saying troops repelled the attack,” he told TheCable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The army chief and other generals only sit in Abuja and lie to Nigerians whereas soldiers are being killed on daily basis. We lack manpower but nobody is telling the president the truth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The president should demand the whereabouts of all the soldiers deployed to Operation Last Hold to fight Boko Haram under Major General Abbah Dikko. The answer is, all of them have been crushed by Boko Haram and their new weapons and arms are what the Boko Haram is using to attack us. Please, help us tell Mr President that the service chiefs are just lying to him.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another soldier said he and his colleagues engaged the insurgents in a gun battle for 40 minutes but they eventually ran out of ammunition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said troops at the formation were alerted about the attack, one hour before the insurgents struck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sakaba told us to prepare for battle after being briefed by one of our soldiers whose duty is to monitor what is coming from distance,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We engaged the terrorists for over 40 minutes before we ran out of ammunition on that very Sunday. They were well equipped and armed with rocket propelled grenades, more than 12 gun trucks mounted with anti-air craft shooting at us from a long range,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Some of us ran out of bullets and they overpowered us, we fled but those who could not escape were slaughtered like chicken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My brother our formation is surrounded by big trenches and barbed wires, which became a trap for our made it difficult for them to escape. I watched many of my fellow friends died helplessly in cold blood.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another soldier who wants to be identified at Gods child, said it was a miracle that they survived the onslaught.

 Those weapons bokoharam are using are newly purchased with ransom mone paid by buhari.Nigeria can afford it but the $1billion budget for arms to fight bokoharam whom lie Mohamed said have been technically defeated have been diverted for his second term election campaign.While buratai and his colleague generals have diverted the rest.

  You people are ridiculous. Why don't you go and join the battle. My friend in the military posted to borno told me that the average weapons boko uses is anti aircraft guns. Their range and intensity is superior to the AK47 Nigerian soldiers.
  <br/>
  Until Nigeria starts procuring F-16s and the like capable of giving cover then Nigeria may continue to lose this battle.

  One of the soldiers who escaped the deadly attack on the military formation in Metele in Borno state has narrated how he escaped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 100 soldiers attached to 157 task force battalion were reportedly killed in the attack while the armoury at the formation was looted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) had claimed responsibility for the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier who spoke off the record said more than 100 of his colleagues fled the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier accused the military authorities of lying to the public about the insurgency in the north-east, calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Most of our people dropped their arms and pulled off this dirty uniform… the bodies of our troops littered everywhere but we watched the news and heard army headquarters saying troops repelled the attack,” he told TheCable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The army chief and other generals only sit in Abuja and lie to Nigerians whereas soldiers are being killed on daily basis. We lack manpower but nobody is telling the president the truth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The president should demand the whereabouts of all the soldiers deployed to Operation Last Hold to fight Boko Haram under Major General Abbah Dikko. The answer is, all of them have been crushed by Boko Haram and their new weapons and arms are what the Boko Haram is using to attack us. Please, help us tell Mr President that the service chiefs are just lying to him.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another soldier said he and his colleagues engaged the insurgents in a gun battle for 40 minutes but they eventually ran out of ammunition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said troops at the formation were alerted about the attack, one hour before the insurgents struck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sakaba told us to prepare for battle after being briefed by one of our soldiers whose duty is to monitor what is coming from distance,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We engaged the terrorists for over 40 minutes before we ran out of ammunition on that very Sunday. They were well equipped and armed with rocket propelled grenades, more than 12 gun trucks mounted with anti-air craft shooting at us from a long range,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Some of us ran out of bullets and they overpowered us, we fled but those who could not escape were slaughtered like chicken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My brother our formation is surrounded by big trenches and barbed wires, which became a trap for our made it difficult for them to escape. I watched many of my fellow friends died helplessly in cold blood.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another soldier who wants to be identified at Gods child, said it was a miracle that they survived the onslaught.

 Those weapons bokoharam are using are newly purchased with ransom mone paid by buhari.Nigeria can afford it but the $1billion budget for arms to fight bokoharam whom lie Mohamed said have been technically defeated have been diverted for his second term election campaign.While buratai and his colleague generals have diverted the rest.

 My brother our army are deadbeat. They are poorly trained. No matter the weapons you give them they will eventually run away. F-16 will not fire it self you know? From that video boko animals were more organized. It was as if NA were sleeping when they came.

The soldiers are shouting that their weapons are outdated/substandard and cannot match those of BH. If we cannot get an immediate answer to this question and nobody's head rolls, PMB should just release and apologize to Dasuki.

 Nigerians are so filled with hate. Y'all have forgotten that these soldiers being ridiculed are sacrificing their lives for ours.  If they stand back or turn back like y'all are saying,  who would protect the citizens of Nigeria.  I expect us to hold our politicians and chief of staff accountable for the huge amount of ammunition allocated to them than hate. Our soldiers are able to long as they have the right ammunition to battle.

 Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in
 <br/>
 such a way that will enable pre - primary school pupils to learn software development and coding .
 <br/>
 Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel
 <br/>
 Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
 <br/>
 Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
 <br/>
 Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
 <br/>
 “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
 <br/>
 “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

 Who will be in charge of teaching the students? Is it the present bulk of teachers that majority can't operate computers? Programming that has not been incorporated fully in B.Sc computer science in the university is what these jokers are promising to nursery students. You have not been able to solve power issues, you are talking about programming? Then with some children doing 15 subjects already, you will now add a very dynamic concept like software development.

  Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in
  <br/>
  such a way that will enable pre - primary school pupils to learn software development and coding .
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel
  <br/>
  Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
  <br/>
  Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
  <br/>
  “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
  <br/>
  “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

  One of the soldiers who escaped the deadly attack on the military formation in Metele in Borno state has narrated how he escaped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 100 soldiers attached to 157 task force battalion were reportedly killed in the attack while the armoury at the formation was looted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) had claimed responsibility for the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier who spoke off the record said more than 100 of his colleagues fled the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier accused the military authorities of lying to the public about the insurgency in the north-east, calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Most of our people dropped their arms and pulled off this dirty uniform… the bodies of our troops littered everywhere but we watched the news and heard army headquarters saying troops repelled the attack,” he told TheCable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The army chief and other generals only sit in Abuja and lie to Nigerians whereas soldiers are being killed on daily basis. We lack manpower but nobody is telling the president the truth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The president should demand the whereabouts of all the soldiers deployed to Operation Last Hold to fight Boko Haram under Major General Abbah Dikko. The answer is, all of them have been crushed by Boko Haram and their new weapons and arms are what the Boko Haram is using to attack us. Please, help us tell Mr President that the service chiefs are just lying to him.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another soldier said he and his colleagues engaged the insurgents in a gun battle for 40 minutes but they eventually ran out of ammunition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said troops at the formation were alerted about the attack, one hour before the insurgents struck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sakaba told us to prepare for battle after being briefed by one of our soldiers whose duty is to monitor what is coming from distance,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We engaged the terrorists for over 40 minutes before we ran out of ammunition on that very Sunday. They were well equipped and armed with rocket propelled grenades, more than 12 gun trucks mounted with anti-air craft shooting at us from a long range,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Some of us ran out of bullets and they overpowered us, we fled but those who could not escape were slaughtered like chicken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My brother our formation is surrounded by big trenches and barbed wires, which became a trap for our made it difficult for them to escape. I watched many of my fellow friends died helplessly in cold blood.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another soldier who wants to be identified at Gods child, said it was a miracle that they survived the onslaught.

 Those weapons bokoharam are using are newly purchased with ransom mone paid by buhari.Nigeria can afford it but the $1billion budget for arms to fight bokoharam whom lie Mohamed said have been technically defeated have been diverted for his second term election campaign.While buratai and his colleague generals have diverted the rest.

 My brother our army are deadbeat. They are poorly trained. No matter the weapons you give them they will eventually run away. F-16 will not fire it self you know? From that video boko animals were more organized. It was as if NA were sleeping when they came.

 I think the boko haram were better armed. He pointed out that they were attacked from a long range which means that the insurgents knew the level of armed that our military could do so they had a better attack strategy.

The soldiers are shouting that their weapons are outdated/substandard and cannot match those of BH. If we cannot get an immediate answer to this question and nobody's head rolls, PMB should just release and apologize to Dasuki.

 You can go and find out from GEJ and Gen. Ihejirika the weapons used that so decimated the Boko haram and other terrorists in the North East that election held in 2015, so much so that the dullard (almighty clueless) was protesting then that they were killing the northern youths?

  My brother our army are deadbeat. They are poorly trained. No matter the weapons you give them they will eventually run away. F-16 will not fire it self you know? From that video boko animals were more organized. It was as if NA were sleeping when they came.

 <br/>
 It really annoys me when I read about this matale attack.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 How can a battalion, commanded by a whole Lt Col, with a population of over four hundred soldiers  be overrun by Bh after getting an hour Intel before the attack.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Let's assume they didn't have enough ammo. One hour is enough to plan a resistance strategy and an escape strategy in case they run out of ammunition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They said they were trapped by the barb wires and trenches around the base. They could have created a secret route before hand so that when they are outgunned, they will have an easy way out.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But what happened, scout came and said "oga, the boys are coming oo" oga replied, "go and tell your men to prepare for battle" and they waited for BHT to bring the war to them while they were on the defensive. After exhausting their ammo, they decided to marte and BHT took advantage and finished them up. even heard bht sent a letter weeks before the attack.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A creative army is not one with the best weapon but one that can make use of minimum resources to achieve maximum impact. Unfortunately, our soldiers were not creative, their superiors in Abuja failed them, the government failed them and they died for nothing.

 A place were 100 soldiers died the least we expect is a thousand terrorist dead bodies , but look at the score NA lost 100 men , BH lost less than ten. isn't this flawless
 <img src="/faces/huh.png" style="width:15px;height:22px;"/>
 . this shows how pathetic our soldiers are when it comes to training, this Ajebo soldier is complaining about "not well equipped" , is it not the same weapons that the NA are running and leaving behind that the BH are using ?, if u have a running mind u will run even if your body is covered with bullet proof from head to toe. but a brave soldiers will fight even without gun, there is knife and there is combat training also. A brave soldier will rather die honourably than to die running away. Please let them know being a soldier is a sacrifice not an enjoying job.

  And the silly snake charmer army chief keeps flexing muscles by killing Shittes for protesting incarceration of their leader while his own boys are stationed at the mercy of BH in the north east.

 Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in
 <br/>
 such a way that will enable pre - primary school pupils to learn software development and coding .
 <br/>
 Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel
 <br/>
 Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
 <br/>
 Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
 <br/>
 Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
 <br/>
 “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
 <br/>
 “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

 IN the last 3years what have you done to lay the foundation for this apart from the school feeding farce!
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Do you want to tech code writing inside dilapidated buildings?
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Who will teach the pupils? The non-existent teachers?
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Even those with the skills to teach; can you pay them more than what they would earn in a blue-chip company?

  Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in
  <br/>
  such a way that will enable pre - primary school pupils to learn software development and coding .
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel
  <br/>
  Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
  <br/>
  Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
  <br/>
  “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
  <br/>
  “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

  One of the soldiers who escaped the deadly attack on the military formation in Metele in Borno state has narrated how he escaped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 100 soldiers attached to 157 task force battalion were reportedly killed in the attack while the armoury at the formation was looted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) had claimed responsibility for the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier who spoke off the record said more than 100 of his colleagues fled the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier accused the military authorities of lying to the public about the insurgency in the north-east, calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Most of our people dropped their arms and pulled off this dirty uniform… the bodies of our troops littered everywhere but we watched the news and heard army headquarters saying troops repelled the attack,” he told TheCable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The army chief and other generals only sit in Abuja and lie to Nigerians whereas soldiers are being killed on daily basis. We lack manpower but nobody is telling the president the truth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The president should demand the whereabouts of all the soldiers deployed to Operation Last Hold to fight Boko Haram under Major General Abbah Dikko. The answer is, all of them have been crushed by Boko Haram and their new weapons and arms are what the Boko Haram is using to attack us. Please, help us tell Mr President that the service chiefs are just lying to him.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another soldier said he and his colleagues engaged the insurgents in a gun battle for 40 minutes but they eventually ran out of ammunition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said troops at the formation were alerted about the attack, one hour before the insurgents struck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sakaba told us to prepare for battle after being briefed by one of our soldiers whose duty is to monitor what is coming from distance,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We engaged the terrorists for over 40 minutes before we ran out of ammunition on that very Sunday. They were well equipped and armed with rocket propelled grenades, more than 12 gun trucks mounted with anti-air craft shooting at us from a long range,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Some of us ran out of bullets and they overpowered us, we fled but those who could not escape were slaughtered like chicken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My brother our formation is surrounded by big trenches and barbed wires, which became a trap for our made it difficult for them to escape. I watched many of my fellow friends died helplessly in cold blood.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another soldier who wants to be identified at Gods child, said it was a miracle that they survived the onslaught.

 Those weapons bokoharam are using are newly purchased with ransom mone paid by buhari.Nigeria can afford it but the $1billion budget for arms to fight bokoharam whom lie Mohamed said have been technically defeated have been diverted for his second term election campaign.While buratai and his colleague generals have diverted the rest.

 Dasuki was accused of sharing money as largesse from the account of the office of the NSA and he is being held for that reason, good and fair. At least GEJ is longer President, Nigerians voted him out, now that PMB is President, question is, what happened to the money earmarked for the purchase of sophisticated equipment for our military? The soldiers are shouting that their weapons are outdated/substandard and cannot match those of BH. If we cannot get an immediate answer to this question and nobody's head rolls, PMB should just release and apologize to Dasuki. It is obvious the military heads are stealing at the expense of these innocent military guys (particularly the soldiers in this instance) who put their lives at risk to protect us. The money they are acquiring is blood money, is that how sweet blood tastes?

 It really annoys me when I read about this matale attack.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 How can a battalion, commanded by a whole Lt Col, with a population of over four hundred soldiers  be overrun by Bh after getting an hour Intel before the attack.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Let's assume they didn't have enough ammo. One hour is enough to plan a resistance strategy and an escape strategy in case they run out of ammunition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They said they were trapped by the barb wires and trenches around the base. They could have created a secret route before hand so that when they are outgunned, they will have an easy way out.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But what happened, scout came and said "oga, the boys are coming oo" oga replied, "go and tell your men to prepare for battle" and they waited for BHT to bring the war to them while they were on the defensive. After exhausting their ammo, they decided to marte and BHT took advantage and finished them up. even heard bht sent a letter weeks before the attack.
 <br/>

 . this shows how pathetic our soldiers are when it comes to training, this Ajebo soldier is complaining about "not well equipped" , is it not the same weapons that the NA are running and leaving behind that the BH are using ?, if u have a running mind u will run even if your body is covered with bullet proof from head to toe. but a brave soldiers will fight even without gun, there is knife and there is combat training also. A brave soldier will rather die honourably than to die running away. Please let them know being a soldier is a sacrifice not an enjoying job.

 That is the problem with Nigerian army. Many of the senior officers at the rank of brigadier generals down know nothing about real warfare. They are only experienced in suppressing social disorder by shooting canisters of tear gas and the regular aim and shoot. War is more abou technique than weapon. Normally, an officer at the rank of Lt Col should be a wizard in the art of warfare but many of those we have now are ajebutters without any battle experience. This is why there was so much casualty.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I remember one of our family friends. he was an old corporal in the army. He was telling us how a platoon commander who is a captain almost landed them into an ambush. at that point he had to shout at the small boy and took over command. in the end they were able to prevail. he said if he didnt go against the captain, he won't be telling the story today. Most of our commissioned officers are lazy and incompetent, they only know how to show force and chase women upandan

 Let's not get too excited. advance warning was from the lookout in the watchtower, not some street level intel. that means by the time that warning came, the battalion was already surrounded, the BH advance was already in progress, they just delayed opening fire by an hour, probably to mess up the mind and morale of the troops.  If a T-72 does not have reactive armour upgrade, anti-tank RPG can knock it out. At the end of the day if the BH has 500 rounds per man, and the NA has 120 rounds per man, after 30 minutes standoff turns to slaughter, pure and simple. The only saviour would have been minimizing ammo (like civil war Owerri siege) and hunkering until backup/air support arrives.

 It's terribly unfair to refer to our troops as cowards, bearing in mind they must obey orders. What is clear is that BH has changed tactics and NA has not, leading to increasing casualties and losses for us. NA wants to fight BH using conventional tactics and heavy weapons ill-suited for northeastern/sahel terrain. Even if they wanted to, it will be suicidal to take the fight to BH using current methods and hardware.

 Easy for you to say from far off. Most of the commanders i've met in NE are NOT from the North; I find this intriguing and disturbing at the same time. This war, you need street cred and local intel like yesterday, you need to get the locals to trust you. As it stands, BH, using terror and coercion, largely have the edge over our boots on the ground. And lest we forget, military high command is feeding fat off this war and don't give a damn about rank and file.

  It really annoys me when I read about this matale attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  How can a battalion, commanded by a whole Lt Col, with a population of over four hundred soldiers  be overrun by Bh after getting an hour Intel before the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Let's assume they didn't have enough ammo. One hour is enough to plan a resistance strategy and an escape strategy in case they run out of ammunition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said they were trapped by the barb wires and trenches around the base. They could have created a secret route before hand so that when they are outgunned, they will have an easy way out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But what happened, scout came and said "oga, the boys are coming oo" oga replied, "go and tell your men to prepare for battle" and they waited for BHT to bring the war to them while they were on the defensive. After exhausting their ammo, they decided to marte and BHT took advantage and finished them up. even heard bht sent a letter weeks before the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A creative army is not one with the best weapon but one that can make use of minimum resources to achieve maximum impact. Unfortunately, our soldiers were not creative, their superiors in Abuja failed them, the government failed them and they died for nothing.
 </blockquote>
 <br/>
 Ive made the point on several threads on the Metele attack. A major problem is training and orientation. The attack was most unfortunate as it was a national embarrassment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 That BH in just Toyota Hilux vans, motor bike, ak47s and a few RPGs could annihilate over 100 soldiers after less than an hour of fight, EVEN WITH ADVANCE WARNING, shows the very poor and pitiable state of the NA.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They keep shouting lack of weapons, but according to the report by PT, BH carted away large cache of weapons from the base. So where did it come from?
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Of course the buck stops with the guys in Abuja, right from Burutai to PMB. We don't have an army

 I don't believe this.

 They got an hour heads up and those killed in the video we watched were not wearing battle gears.
 <br/>
 They had at least one T 71 tank in that base and if it had coughed on the insurgents twice, they would all be dead.

 Finally, if they ran out of arms, which weapons were in the armoury for the insurgents to loot?

  Bros you no go understand, ambush needs enough mobile weapons and heavy explosives. Again, remember the soldiers don't have one mind. In a game of football, when everyone is not willing to attack, na losing all through. The commander or the head is responsible. I blame the soldiers for not acting like our olding day soldiers.

I don't expect this to have gone to that level judging from the volatile counter insurgency operations going on.

  That is the problem with Nigerian army. Many of the senior officers at the rank of brigadier generals down know nothing about real warfare. They are only experienced in suppressing social disorder by shooting canisters of tear gas and the regular aim and shoot. War is more abou technique than weapon. Normally, an officer at the rank of Lt Col should be a wizard in the art of warfare but many of those we have now are ajebutters without any battle experience. This is why there was so much casualty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I remember one of our family friends. he was an old corporal in the army. He was telling us how a platoon commander who is a captain almost landed them into an ambush. at that point he had to shout at the small boy and took over command. in the end they were able to prevail. he said if he didnt go against the captain, he won't be telling the story today. Most of our commissioned officers are lazy and incompetent, they only know how to show force and chase women upandan
  <br/>
 </blockquote>
 <br/>
 You see, the case of corporal and captain you mentioned reminds me of the situation in Vietnam.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The American officers at that time were young and fresh graduates of the military academy at west point without any real battle experience. It resulted in friction between the officers and the veteran grunts (corporals, sergeant et all) who felt that the young officers were novices in battle and were leading them astray.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This cost them the war. At the end of the Vietnam war, the US armed forces chiefs reviewed the situation and observes that most newly commissioned officers haven't tasted battle and had no experience. What they were been taught in the academy didn't mirror real battle conditions and such newly commissioned officers were ill-prepared for realities of warfare. This contributed to the huge no of casualties experienced by the Americans.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I'm sure the same thing is playing out in the Nigerian army against terrorists

  You people are ridiculous. Why don't you go and join the battle. My friend in the military posted to borno told me that the average weapons boko uses is anti aircraft guns. Their range and intensity is superior to the AK47 Nigerian soldiers.

  Until Nigeria starts procuring F-16s and the like capable of giving cover then Nigeria may continue to lose this battle.

 Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in
 <br/>
 such a way that will enable pre - primary school pupils to learn software development and coding .
 <br/>
 Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel
 <br/>
 Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
 <br/>
 Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
 <br/>
 Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
 <br/>
 “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
 <br/>
 “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

  Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
  <br/>
  Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
  <br/>
  “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
  <br/>
  “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

 If by bad man management you're talking about Costa's case, then you're clearly wrong on that.

 Diego was trying to get back Player power that dominated the dressing room during the J. Terry's era. Either way Costa had to leave.

 <br/>
 Tactical flexibility when you have a bunch of stiff players who can't do nothing when switched on opposite wings?

 I had an argument here before about how Conte was not given ultimate decision over players he wanted.

  Conte is a good coach but he has seniors. Every other thing you said here is hot garbage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Conte took over a Juve team that had finished 7th twice before he came. They were not a relegated team. Not even close.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is a pragmatic defensive coach which is why Mou kept throwing shade that CFC should not be celebrating him for winning defensively when he, Mou, was criticised for doing same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Conte was known for packing draws. His first league season was heavily dependent on drawing games whereas Pep is known for crushing opposing teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Conte left Juve, they have faired better. Same cannot be said about Barca.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pressure in Barca is the most- making it the most difficult job in the world because you must win by playing exquisitely. It is for this reason Mou was not hired when he begged for the job in 08.

  None of these is below 20M

 Read back to where the argument started.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Someone referred to the most expensive team XI and Bench as not having the best players
 <br/>
 <br/>
 So tell me, if they don't have the best players, who should?
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chelsea transfer is justified from sale of top players, who did Man City sell for a reasonable amount?

  That's the problem, Price tag.. Blame that on the selling clubs not the players, stones costs more than Bonucci, is he more of a star than him?  you can call the squad expensive but not star studded, how well did you know Jesus, Sane, mendy, ederson before pep signed them?  Was stones not regarded as the worst defender in the league last season alongside otamendi?  Is it the same overrated Walker that is now world class?

  North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has bragged that his country has achieved full nuclear statehood after successfully testing a new missile capable of hitting virtually anywhere in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country ended a 10-week pause in its weapons testing on Tuesday when it fired off a Hwasong-15 rocket - its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile yet which the regime claimed could be fitted with a 'super heavy nuclear warhead'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It poses a new challenge for President Donald Trump who has vowed not to let North Korea develop nuclear missiles that can hit the US mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After watching the launch, Kim Jong-un boasted about its success, according to state television presenter Ri Chun-Hee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'Kim Jong-un declared with pride that now we have finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force, the cause of building a rocket power,' the presenter said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'The great success in the test-fire of ICBM Hwasong-15 is a priceless victory won by the great and heroic people of the DPRK,' she added, using the abbreviated name for North Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis warned on Tuesday that North Korea now has the ability to hit 'everywhere in the world' and that the latest missile test went 'higher, frankly, than any previous shot they have taken.'

 Broo please, don't put them in the same sentence.

 Mikel had a tougher job to do. Breakup play, protect the back four. it takes a lot of discipline to do that.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yoko is allowed to roam, but what he does with that, I have no idea.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I've seen signings come and go, even when it took Ramires 5 touches to get the ball at rest, the guy was trying to impress.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 My problem with Bakayoko is he's got no ZEAL, nothing. He needs a change of attitude like heck.

 Once you get the 5th yellow card, it's official you'll miss a game.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 So the extra yellow only counts when you get up to 10 yellow cards in the league.

 Cards are wiped after the first half of the season BTW.

  strength is very important for a striker.
  <br/>
  First off. I'm a huge morata fan, i was very dissapointed and still am that he left madrid I'm not really a fan of chelsea but i sometimes watch chelsea games coz of morata.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Morata sometimes struggles to remain on his feet. If he  can improve that about him, he just needs a few more tweaks and then he is the finished version.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lukaku can stay on his feet regardless of the strength of the opponent.  He can hold/guard the ball and wait for his teammate the pass. There were scenarios he did that in his most recent game against newcastle. That strength is very important because he can also use it to bully defenders and move through them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That strength was also visible as he ferociously smashed his goal against newcastle. Even if the goalkeeper got a hand on it, i doubt he could prevent it from going in
 </blockquote>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yes, Morata needs to work on his strength so as Lukaku needs to work on his header, link up play, and his big mouth off the pitch too.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Did you watch Ruud boy at Man United or Bergkamp at Arsenal? Strength weren't their biggest asset yet they wrote their names in the history books.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 As a player you can't have everything, there are bound to be weaknesses. They're both doing well for their clubs and that should be enough.

 <i>
  Professor Canavero, director of the Turin Advanced Neuromodulation Group, made the announcement at a press conference in Vienna this morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The procedure was carried out by a team led by Dr Xiaoping Ren, who last year grafted a head onto the body of a monkey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A full report of the Harbin Medical University team's procedure and a timeframe for the live transplant are expected within the next few days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the press conference, Professor Canavero said: 'For too long nature has dictated her rules to us.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'We're born, we grow, we age and we die. For millions of years humans has evolved and 110 billion humans have died in the process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'That's genocide on a mass scale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'We have entered an age where we will take our destiny back in our hands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'It will change everything. It will change you at every level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'The first human head transplant, in the human mode, has been realised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'The surgery lasted 18 hours. The paper will be released in a few days.'
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'Everyone said it was impossible, but the surgery was successful.'
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Canavero added that the team's next step is to perform a full head swap between brain dead organ donors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And that is the final step for the formal head transplant for a medical condition which is imminent,' he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'It will be for a medical, neurological condition, not for life-extension.'
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked whether the eventual plans for live procedures would go worldwide after initial tests in China, Professor Canavero said: 'Given the amount of mean criticism we recieved I don't think we should go international.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'For instance, if you still stick to the Frankenstein schtick, which doesn't make sense, then no.

  PREPARATION FOR THE PROCEDURE
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May, scientists carried out a head transplant on a rat in a practise run for controversial human experiment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers used three rats for each operation: a smaller rat, to be the donor, and two larger rats, acting as the recipient and the blood supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To maintain blood flow to the donor brain, they connected the blood vessels from that rat to veins of the third rat using a silicon tube, which was then passed through a peristaltic pump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then, once the head had been transplanted onto the second rat's body, the researchers used vascular grafts to connect the donor's thoracic aorta and superior vena cava to the carotid artery and extracorporeal veins of the recipient.

 The world's first human head transplant has been carried out on a corpse in China, according to Italian professor Sergio Canavero.

 <br/>
 During an 18-hour operation, experts demonstrated that it is possible to successfully reconnect the spine, nerves and blood vessels of a severed head.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A similar operation on a live human will take place 'imminently', the controversial professor claims.

  ? This is the most often question I ask my self when I see the way some Girls behave around the campus and even outside.... To be specificic those that are beautiful, they always think they are the ones controlling guys head, the ones who have the saying always... Many of them are so snubbish and ill mannered, they talk to you as if ''your a magaa''... Somma them even think with what they have they can make guys go crazy, I wonder what is that but I will soon find out...those I found more irritating is those that call themselves ''slay queens'' mehn these typa Girls Hot sha but they irritating to me.... What more can I say, lastly the silent mamma's that don't have Guys time, they won't talk to u even u talk to them., when u say Hi their next reaction is one kind bad look to u,some go extramile hissing... I go slap this kind Girl oneday.... Anyway what can u say about this then.....I don give up on Girls for Now.....,...I don go break abeg, the girls don tire me with there wahala.......

 Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in
 <br/>
 such a way that will enable pre - primary school pupils to learn software development and coding .
 <br/>
 Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel
 <br/>
 Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
 <br/>
 Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
 <br/>
 Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
 <br/>
 “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
 <br/>
 “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

  Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in

  <br/>
  Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel
  <br/>
  Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
  <br/>
  Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
  <br/>
  “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
  <br/>
  “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

Many of them are so snubbish and ill mannered, they talk to you as if ''your a magaa''... Somma them even think with what they have they can make guys go crazy, I wonder what is that but I will soon find out...those I found more irritating is those that call themselves ''slay queens'' mehn these typa Girls Hot sha but they irritating to me.... What more can I say, lastly the silent mamma's that don't have Guys time, they won't talk to u even u talk to them., when u say Hi their next reaction is one kind bad look to u,some go extramile hissing... I go slap this kind Girl oneday.... Anyway what can u say about this then.....I don give up on Girls for Now.....,...I don go break abeg, the girls don tire me with there wahala.......

  The Nigerian banking space is fiercely competitive; only the fittest survive. Maintaining the minimum capital base means adopting aggressive marketing techniques and a cutting edge corporate culture. The pressure this goal places on bank workers makes banking one of the least enviable professions in Nigeria today. Below are some of things that Nigerian bankers hate about their jobs...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1.	Perennial late closing hours

  2.	Being engaged on a contract basis and earning far less than other permanent staff

To be specificic those that are beautiful, they always think they are the ones controlling guys head, the ones who have the saying always... Many of them are so snubbish and ill mannered, they talk to you as if ''your a magaa''... Somma them even think with what they have they can make guys go crazy, I wonder what is that but I will soon find out...those I found more irritating is those that call themselves ''slay queens'' mehn these typa Girls Hot sha but they irritating to me.... What more can I say, lastly the silent mamma's that don't have Guys time, they won't talk to u even u talk to them., when u say Hi their next reaction is one kind bad look to u,some go extramile hissing... I go slap this kind Girl oneday.... Anyway what can u say about this then.....I don give up on Girls for Now.....,...I don go break abeg, the girls don tire me with there wahala.......

  One of the soldiers who escaped the deadly attack on the military formation in Metele in Borno state has narrated how he escaped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 100 soldiers attached to 157 task force battalion were reportedly killed in the attack while the armoury at the formation was looted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) had claimed responsibility for the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier who spoke off the record said more than 100 of his colleagues fled the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier accused the military authorities of lying to the public about the insurgency in the north-east, calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to act.

  “Most of our people dropped their arms and pulled off this dirty uniform… the bodies of our troops littered everywhere but we watched the news and heard army headquarters saying troops repelled the attack,” he told TheCable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The army chief and other generals only sit in Abuja and lie to Nigerians whereas soldiers are being killed on daily basis. We lack manpower but nobody is telling the president the truth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The president should demand the whereabouts of all the soldiers deployed to Operation Last Hold to fight Boko Haram under Major General Abbah Dikko. The answer is, all of them have been crushed by Boko Haram and their new weapons and arms are what the Boko Haram is using to attack us. Please, help us tell Mr President that the service chiefs are just lying to him.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another soldier said he and his colleagues engaged the insurgents in a gun battle for 40 minutes but they eventually ran out of ammunition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said troops at the formation were alerted about the attack, one hour before the insurgents struck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sakaba told us to prepare for battle after being briefed by one of our soldiers whose duty is to monitor what is coming from distance,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We engaged the terrorists for over 40 minutes before we ran out of ammunition on that very Sunday. They were well equipped and armed with rocket propelled grenades, more than 12 gun trucks mounted with anti-air craft shooting at us from a long range,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Some of us ran out of bullets and they overpowered us, we fled but those who could not escape were slaughtered like chicken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My brother our formation is surrounded by big trenches and barbed wires, which became a trap for our made it difficult for them to escape. I watched many of my fellow friends died helplessly in cold blood.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another soldier who wants to be identified at Gods child, said it was a miracle that they survived the onslaught.

 Those weapons bokoharam are using are newly purchased with ransom mone paid by buhari.Nigeria can afford it but the $1billion budget for arms to fight bokoharam whom lie Mohamed said have been technically defeated have been diverted for his second term election campaign.While buratai and his colleague generals have diverted the rest.

 Terrorism is big business. If you know, you know.

 Suddenly where did the trucks and weapons of the so called Boko haram come from? So we don't have drones giving us live feed of the North east region?

The soldiers are shouting that their weapons are outdated/substandard and cannot match those of BH. If we cannot get an immediate answer to this question and nobody's head rolls, PMB should just release and apologize to Dasuki.

 It really annoys me when I read about this matale attack.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 How can a battalion, commanded by a whole Lt Col, with a population of over four hundred soldiers  be overrun by Bh after getting an hour Intel before the attack.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Let's assume they didn't have enough ammo. One hour is enough to plan a resistance strategy and an escape strategy in case they run out of ammunition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They said they were trapped by the barb wires and trenches around the base. They could have created a secret route before hand so that when they are outgunned, they will have an easy way out.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But what happened, scout came and said "oga, the boys are coming oo" oga replied, "go and tell your men to prepare for battle" and they waited for BHT to bring the war to them while they were on the defensive. After exhausting their ammo, they decided to marte and BHT took advantage and finished them up. even heard bht sent a letter weeks before the attack.
 <br/>

  PDP should teach APC how to combat Boko Haram so that  the Nigerian Army will come out victorious.

  It really annoys me when I read about this matale attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  How can a battalion, commanded by a whole Lt Col, with a population of over four hundred soldiers  be overrun by Bh after getting an hour Intel before the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Let's assume they didn't have enough ammo. One hour is enough to plan a resistance strategy and an escape strategy in case they run out of ammunition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said they were trapped by the barb wires and trenches around the base. They could have created a secret route before hand so that when they are outgunned, they will have an easy way out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But what happened, scout came and said "oga, the boys are coming oo" oga replied, "go and tell your men to prepare for battle" and they waited for BHT to bring the war to them while they were on the defensive. After exhausting their ammo, they decided to marte and BHT took advantage and finished them up. even heard bht sent a letter weeks before the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A creative army is not one with the best weapon but one that can make use of minimum resources to achieve maximum impact. Unfortunately, our soldiers were not creative, their superiors in Abuja failed them, the government failed them and they died for nothing.

 That is the problem with Nigerian army. Many of the senior officers at the rank of brigadier generals down know nothing about real warfare. They are only experienced in suppressing social disorder by shooting canisters of tear gas and the regular aim and shoot. War is more abou technique than weapon. Normally, an officer at the rank of Lt Col should be a wizard in the art of warfare but many of those we have now are ajebutters without any battle experience. This is why there was so much casualty.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I remember one of our family friends. he was an old corporal in the army. He was telling us how a platoon commander who is a captain almost landed them into an ambush. at that point he had to shout at the small boy and took over command. in the end they were able to prevail. he said if he didnt go against the captain, he won't be telling the story today. Most of our commissioned officers are lazy and incompetent, they only know how to show force and chase women upandan

 Let's not get too excited. advance warning was from the lookout in the watchtower, not some street level intel. that means by the time that warning came, the battalion was already surrounded, the BH advance was already in progress, they just delayed opening fire by an hour, probably to mess up the mind and morale of the troops.  If a T-72 does not have reactive armour upgrade, anti-tank RPG can knock it out. At the end of the day if the BH has 500 rounds per man, and the NA has 120 rounds per man, after 30 minutes standoff turns to slaughter, pure and simple. The only saviour would have been minimizing ammo (like civil war Owerri siege) and hunkering until backup/air support arrives.

  Let's not get too excited. advance warning was from the lookout in the watchtower, not some street level intel. that means by the time that warning came, the battalion was already surrounded, the BH advance was already in progress, they just delayed opening fire by an hour, probably to mess up the mind and morale of the troops.  If a T-72 does not have reactive armour upgrade, anti-tank RPG can knock it out. At the end of the day if the BH has 500 rounds per man, and the NA has 120 rounds per man, after 30 minutes standoff turns to slaughter, pure and simple. The only saviour would have been minimizing ammo (like civil war Owerri siege) and hunkering until backup/air support arrives.

 It's terribly unfair to refer to our troops as cowards, bearing in mind they must obey orders. What is clear is that BH has changed tactics and NA has not, leading to increasing casualties and losses for us. NA wants to fight BH using conventional tactics and heavy weapons ill-suited for northeastern/sahel terrain. Even if they wanted to, it will be suicidal to take the fight to BH using current methods and hardware.

  If I'd been in Borno, i'd've been commander and I'd never have been outwitted by no ape-brained Bokoharam scum-bag. I'm an individual that trusts no one and always anticipate situations.

 Easy for you to say from far off. Most of the commanders i've met in NE are NOT from the North; I find this intriguing and disturbing at the same time. This war, you need street cred and local intel like yesterday, you need to get the locals to trust you. As it stands, BH, using terror and coercion, largely have the edge over our boots on the ground. And lest we forget, military high command is feeding fat off this war and don't give a damn about rank and file.

  It really annoys me when I read about this matale attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  How can a battalion, commanded by a whole Lt Col, with a population of over four hundred soldiers  be overrun by Bh after getting an hour Intel before the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Let's assume they didn't have enough ammo. One hour is enough to plan a resistance strategy and an escape strategy in case they run out of ammunition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said they were trapped by the barb wires and trenches around the base. They could have created a secret route before hand so that when they are outgunned, they will have an easy way out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But what happened, scout came and said "oga, the boys are coming oo" oga replied, "go and tell your men to prepare for battle" and they waited for BHT to bring the war to them while they were on the defensive. After exhausting their ammo, they decided to marte and BHT took advantage and finished them up. even heard bht sent a letter weeks before the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A creative army is not one with the best weapon but one that can make use of minimum resources to achieve maximum impact. Unfortunately, our soldiers were not creative, their superiors in Abuja failed them, the government failed them and they died for nothing.
 </blockquote>
 <br/>
 Ive made the point on several threads on the Metele attack. A major problem is training and orientation. The attack was most unfortunate as it was a national embarrassment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 That BH in just Toyota Hilux vans, motor bike, ak47s and a few RPGs could annihilate over 100 soldiers after less than an hour of fight, EVEN WITH ADVANCE WARNING, shows the very poor and pitiable state of the NA.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They keep shouting lack of weapons, but according to the report by PT, BH carted away large cache of weapons from the base. So where did it come from?
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Of course the buck stops with the guys in Abuja, right from Burutai to PMB. We don't have an army

 I don't believe this.

 They got an hour heads up and those killed in the video we watched were not wearing battle gears.
 <br/>
 They had at least one T 71 tank in that base and if it had coughed on the insurgents twice, they would all be dead.

 Finally, if they ran out of arms, which weapons were in the armoury for the insurgents to loot?

  That is the problem with Nigerian army. Many of the senior officers at the rank of brigadier generals down know nothing about real warfare. They are only experienced in suppressing social disorder by shooting canisters of tear gas and the regular aim and shoot. War is more abou technique than weapon. Normally, an officer at the rank of Lt Col should be a wizard in the art of warfare but many of those we have now are ajebutters without any battle experience. This is why there was so much casualty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I remember one of our family friends. he was an old corporal in the army. He was telling us how a platoon commander who is a captain almost landed them into an ambush. at that point he had to shout at the small boy and took over command. in the end they were able to prevail. he said if he didnt go against the captain, he won't be telling the story today. Most of our commissioned officers are lazy and incompetent, they only know how to show force and chase women upandan
  <br/>
 </blockquote>
 <br/>
 You see, the case of corporal and captain you mentioned reminds me of the situation in Vietnam.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The American officers at that time were young and fresh graduates of the military academy at west point without any real battle experience. It resulted in friction between the officers and the veteran grunts (corporals, sergeant et all) who felt that the young officers were novices in battle and were leading them astray.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This cost them the war. At the end of the Vietnam war, the US armed forces chiefs reviewed the situation and observes that most newly commissioned officers haven't tasted battle and had no experience. What they were been taught in the academy didn't mirror real battle conditions and such newly commissioned officers were ill-prepared for realities of warfare. This contributed to the huge no of casualties experienced by the Americans.

 I'm sure the same thing is playing out in the Nigerian army against terrorists

 Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in
 <br/>
 such a way that will enable pre - primary school pupils to learn software development and coding .
 <br/>
 Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel
 <br/>
 Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
 <br/>
 Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
 <br/>
 Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
 <br/>
 “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
 <br/>
 “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

  Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in
  <br/>
  such a way that will enable pre - primary school pupils to learn software development and coding .
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel
  <br/>
  Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
  <br/>
  Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
  <br/>
  “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
  <br/>
  “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

 If by bad man management you're talking about Costa's case, then you're clearly wrong on that.

 Diego was trying to get back Player power that dominated the dressing room during the J. Terry's era. Either way Costa had to leave.

 Tactical flexibility when you have a bunch of stiff players who can't do nothing when switched on opposite wings?

 I had an argument here before about how Conte was not given ultimate decision over players he wanted.

  Conte is a good coach but he has seniors. Every other thing you said here is hot garbage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Conte took over a Juve team that had finished 7th twice before he came. They were not a relegated team. Not even close.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is a pragmatic defensive coach which is why Mou kept throwing shade that CFC should not be celebrating him for winning defensively when he, Mou, was criticised for doing same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Conte was known for packing draws. His first league season was heavily dependent on drawing games whereas Pep is known for crushing opposing teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Conte left Juve, they have faired better. Same cannot be said about Barca.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pressure in Barca is the most- making it the most difficult job in the world because you must win by playing exquisitely. It is for this reason Mou was not hired when he begged for the job in 08.

 I don't know where you got all that, but the only player we actually bid was Sandro, time and again.

 If you don't know about this, know now. There are players club sign without the Team coaches sanctioning the transfer.

 Nobody's arguing about them pulling of the one of the best transfers in England but the summer was a wreck. even the coach was basically pleading to complete deals.

  North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has bragged that his country has achieved full nuclear statehood after successfully testing a new missile capable of hitting virtually anywhere in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country ended a 10-week pause in its weapons testing on Tuesday when it fired off a Hwasong-15 rocket - its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile yet which the regime claimed could be fitted with a 'super heavy nuclear warhead'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It poses a new challenge for President Donald Trump who has vowed not to let North Korea develop nuclear missiles that can hit the US mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After watching the launch, Kim Jong-un boasted about its success, according to state television presenter Ri Chun-Hee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'Kim Jong-un declared with pride that now we have finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force, the cause of building a rocket power,' the presenter said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'The great success in the test-fire of ICBM Hwasong-15 is a priceless victory won by the great and heroic people of the DPRK,' she added, using the abbreviated name for North Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis warned on Tuesday that North Korea now has the ability to hit 'everywhere in the world' and that the latest missile test went 'higher, frankly, than any previous shot they have taken.'

 Once you get the 5th yellow card, it's official you'll miss a game.

  strength is very important for a striker.
  <br/>
  First off. I'm a huge morata fan, i was very dissapointed and still am that he left madrid I'm not really a fan of chelsea but i sometimes watch chelsea games coz of morata.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Morata sometimes struggles to remain on his feet. If he  can improve that about him, he just needs a few more tweaks and then he is the finished version.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lukaku can stay on his feet regardless of the strength of the opponent.  He can hold/guard the ball and wait for his teammate the pass. There were scenarios he did that in his most recent game against newcastle. That strength is very important because he can also use it to bully defenders and move through them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That strength was also visible as he ferociously smashed his goal against newcastle. Even if the goalkeeper got a hand on it, i doubt he could prevent it from going in
 </blockquote>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yes, Morata needs to work on his strength so as Lukaku needs to work on his header, link up play, and his big mouth off the pitch too.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Did you watch Ruud boy at Man United or Bergkamp at Arsenal? Strength weren't their biggest asset yet they wrote their names in the history books.

 As a player you can't have everything, there are bound to be weaknesses. They're both doing well for their clubs and that should be enough.

  Professor Canavero, director of the Turin Advanced Neuromodulation Group, made the announcement at a press conference in Vienna this morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The procedure was carried out by a team led by Dr Xiaoping Ren, who last year grafted a head onto the body of a monkey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A full report of the Harbin Medical University team's procedure and a timeframe for the live transplant are expected within the next few days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the press conference, Professor Canavero said: 'For too long nature has dictated her rules to us.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'We're born, we grow, we age and we die. For millions of years humans has evolved and 110 billion humans have died in the process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'That's genocide on a mass scale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'We have entered an age where we will take our destiny back in our hands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'It will change everything. It will change you at every level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'The first human head transplant, in the human mode, has been realised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'The surgery lasted 18 hours. The paper will be released in a few days.'
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'Everyone said it was impossible, but the surgery was successful.'
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Canavero added that the team's next step is to perform a full head swap between brain dead organ donors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And that is the final step for the formal head transplant for a medical condition which is imminent,' he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'It will be for a medical, neurological condition, not for life-extension.'
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked whether the eventual plans for live procedures would go worldwide after initial tests in China, Professor Canavero said: 'Given the amount of mean criticism we recieved I don't think we should go international.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'For instance, if you still stick to the Frankenstein schtick, which doesn't make sense, then no.

  PREPARATION FOR THE PROCEDURE
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May, scientists carried out a head transplant on a rat in a practise run for controversial human experiment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers used three rats for each operation: a smaller rat, to be the donor, and two larger rats, acting as the recipient and the blood supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To maintain blood flow to the donor brain, they connected the blood vessels from that rat to veins of the third rat using a silicon tube, which was then passed through a peristaltic pump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then, once the head had been transplanted onto the second rat's body, the researchers used vascular grafts to connect the donor's thoracic aorta and superior vena cava to the carotid artery and extracorporeal veins of the recipient.

To be specificic those that are beautiful, they always think they are the ones controlling guys head, the ones who have the saying always... Many of them are so snubbish and ill mannered, they talk to you as if ''your a magaa''... Somma them even think with what they have they can make guys go crazy, I wonder what is that but I will soon find out...those I found more irritating is those that call themselves ''slay queens'' mehn these typa Girls Hot sha but they irritating to me.... What more can I say, lastly the silent mamma's that don't have Guys time, they won't talk to u even u talk to them., when u say Hi their next reaction is one kind bad look to u,some go extramile hissing... I go slap this kind Girl oneday.... Anyway what can u say about this then.....I don give up on Girls for Now.....,...I don go break abeg, the girls don tire me with there wahala.......

  The Nigerian banking space is fiercely competitive; only the fittest survive. Maintaining the minimum capital base means adopting aggressive marketing techniques and a cutting edge corporate culture. The pressure this goal places on bank workers makes banking one of the least enviable professions in Nigeria today. Below are some of things that Nigerian bankers hate about their jobs...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1.	Perennial late closing hours
  <br/>
  2.	Being engaged on a contract basis and earning far less than other permanent staff
  <br/>
  3.	Having to work 50 hours and above every week including weekends
  <br/>
  4.	Non-existent study leave
  <br/>
  5.	Unrealistic job target
  <br/>

  ? This is the most often question I ask my self when I see the way some Girls behave around the campus and even outside.... To be specificic those that are beautiful, they always think they are the ones controlling guys head, the ones who have the saying always... Many of them are so snubbish and ill mannered, they talk to you as if ''your a magaa''... Somma them even think with what they have they can make guys go crazy, I wonder what is that but I will soon find out...those I found more irritating is those that call themselves ''slay queens'' mehn these typa Girls Hot sha but they irritating to me.... What more can I say, lastly the silent mamma's that don't have Guys time, they won't talk to u even u talk to them., when u say Hi their next reaction is one kind bad look to u,some go extramile hissing... I go slap this kind Girl oneday.... Anyway what can u say about this then.....I don give up on Girls for Now.....,...I don go break abeg, the girls don tire me with there wahala.......

 Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in
 <br/>
 such a way that will enable pre - primary school pupils to learn software development and coding .
 <br/>
 Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel
 <br/>
 Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
 <br/>
 Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
 <br/>
 Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
 <br/>
 “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
 <br/>
 “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

 <br/>
 <br/>
 Who will be in charge of teaching the students? Is it the present bulk of teachers that majority can't operate computers? Programming that has not been incorporated fully in B.Sc computer science in the university is what these jokers are promising to nursery students. You have not been able to solve power issues, you are talking about programming? Then with some children doing 15 subjects already, you will now add a very dynamic concept like software development.

  Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in
  <br/>
  such a way that will enable pre - primary school pupils to learn software development and coding .
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel
  <br/>
  Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
  <br/>
  Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
  <br/>
  “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
  <br/>
  “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

  One of the soldiers who escaped the deadly attack on the military formation in Metele in Borno state has narrated how he escaped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 100 soldiers attached to 157 task force battalion were reportedly killed in the attack while the armoury at the formation was looted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) had claimed responsibility for the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier who spoke off the record said more than 100 of his colleagues fled the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier accused the military authorities of lying to the public about the insurgency in the north-east, calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Most of our people dropped their arms and pulled off this dirty uniform… the bodies of our troops littered everywhere but we watched the news and heard army headquarters saying troops repelled the attack,” he told TheCable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The army chief and other generals only sit in Abuja and lie to Nigerians whereas soldiers are being killed on daily basis. We lack manpower but nobody is telling the president the truth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The president should demand the whereabouts of all the soldiers deployed to Operation Last Hold to fight Boko Haram under Major General Abbah Dikko. The answer is, all of them have been crushed by Boko Haram and their new weapons and arms are what the Boko Haram is using to attack us. Please, help us tell Mr President that the service chiefs are just lying to him.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another soldier said he and his colleagues engaged the insurgents in a gun battle for 40 minutes but they eventually ran out of ammunition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said troops at the formation were alerted about the attack, one hour before the insurgents struck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sakaba told us to prepare for battle after being briefed by one of our soldiers whose duty is to monitor what is coming from distance,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We engaged the terrorists for over 40 minutes before we ran out of ammunition on that very Sunday. They were well equipped and armed with rocket propelled grenades, more than 12 gun trucks mounted with anti-air craft shooting at us from a long range,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Some of us ran out of bullets and they overpowered us, we fled but those who could not escape were slaughtered like chicken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My brother our formation is surrounded by big trenches and barbed wires, which became a trap for our made it difficult for them to escape. I watched many of my fellow friends died helplessly in cold blood.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another soldier who wants to be identified at Gods child, said it was a miracle that they survived the onslaught.

 Those weapons bokoharam are using are newly purchased with ransom mone paid by buhari.Nigeria can afford it but the $1billion budget for arms to fight bokoharam whom lie Mohamed said have been technically defeated have been diverted for his second term election campaign.While buratai and his colleague generals have diverted the rest.

 The Americans will demand a base which will prove counterproductive for us as a US base on our soil could turn a magnet for all terrorists groups in the Sahel.

The soldiers are shouting that their weapons are outdated/substandard and cannot match those of BH. If we cannot get an immediate answer to this question and nobody's head rolls, PMB should just release and apologize to Dasuki.

  You people are ridiculous. Why don't you go and join the battle. My friend in the military posted to borno told me that the average weapons boko uses is anti aircraft guns. Their range and intensity is superior to the AK47 Nigerian soldiers.
  <br/>
  Until Nigeria starts procuring F-16s and the like capable of giving cover then Nigeria may continue to lose this battle.

  It might be time for us to call in the US Airforce for assistance in this war.

 You can go and find out from GEJ and Gen. Ihejirika the weapons used that so decimated the Boko haram and other terrorists in the North East that election held in 2015, so much so that the dullard (almighty clueless) was protesting then that they were killing the northern youths?

  My brother our army are deadbeat. They are poorly trained. No matter the weapons you give them they will eventually run away. F-16 will not fire it self you know? From that video boko animals were more organized. It was as if NA were sleeping when they came.

 It really annoys me when I read about this matale attack.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 How can a battalion, commanded by a whole Lt Col, with a population of over four hundred soldiers  be overrun by Bh after getting an hour Intel before the attack.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Let's assume they didn't have enough ammo. One hour is enough to plan a resistance strategy and an escape strategy in case they run out of ammunition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They said they were trapped by the barb wires and trenches around the base. They could have created a secret route before hand so that when they are outgunned, they will have an easy way out.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But what happened, scout came and said "oga, the boys are coming oo" oga replied, "go and tell your men to prepare for battle" and they waited for BHT to bring the war to them while they were on the defensive. After exhausting their ammo, they decided to marte and BHT took advantage and finished them up. even heard bht sent a letter weeks before the attack.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A creative army is not one with the best weapon but one that can make use of minimum resources to achieve maximum impact. Unfortunately, our soldiers were not creative, their superiors in Abuja failed them, the government failed them and they died for nothing.

 A place were 100 soldiers died the least we expect is a thousand terrorist dead bodies , but look at the score NA lost 100 men , BH lost less than ten. isn't this flawless
 <img src="/faces/huh.png" style="width:15px;height:22px;"/>
 . this shows how pathetic our soldiers are when it comes to training, this Ajebo soldier is complaining about "not well equipped" , is it not the same weapons that the NA are running and leaving behind that the BH are using ?, if u have a running mind u will run even if your body is covered with bullet proof from head to toe. but a brave soldiers will fight even without gun, there is knife and there is combat training also. A brave soldier will rather die honourably than to die running away. Please let them know being a soldier is a sacrifice not an enjoying job.

  Just imagine this. The APC and NA should stop feeding Nigerians lies. They purposely created a media blackout of BH activities in the north east to deceive people into believing they are winning the war.

  <br/>
  And the silly snake charmer army chief keeps flexing muscles by killing Shittes for protesting incarceration of their leader while his own boys are stationed at the mercy of BH in the north east.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeye service chiefs who would rather sing praises of a brainless dullard than ensure their boys are well armed to protect the country.

  <br/>
  As far as I am concerned soldiers posted to the north east are mere pawns in the Boko haram chess game by some top military brass, northern politicians / leaders.

 It's painful woh, but seriously boko Haram dey massacre soldiers recently, our army got some serious casualties that are not even reported at all. I used to have passion for the military but even my senior for school advice me not to join, I was skeptical but when I observed how the political elites &amp; our useless generals are playing ping pong with the life's of the soldiers &amp; the shear bodies in mortuaries, plus the way our troops escape from battles immediately they hear B.H approaching, I totally lost interest in the army

 That is the problem with Nigerian army. Many of the senior officers at the rank of brigadier generals down know nothing about real warfare. They are only experienced in suppressing social disorder by shooting canisters of tear gas and the regular aim and shoot. War is more abou technique than weapon. Normally, an officer at the rank of Lt Col should be a wizard in the art of warfare but many of those we have now are ajebutters without any battle experience. This is why there was so much casualty.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I remember one of our family friends. he was an old corporal in the army. He was telling us how a platoon commander who is a captain almost landed them into an ambush. at that point he had to shout at the small boy and took over command. in the end they were able to prevail. he said if he didnt go against the captain, he won't be telling the story today. Most of our commissioned officers are lazy and incompetent, they only know how to show force and chase women upandan

 Let's not get too excited. advance warning was from the lookout in the watchtower, not some street level intel. that means by the time that warning came, the battalion was already surrounded, the BH advance was already in progress, they just delayed opening fire by an hour, probably to mess up the mind and morale of the troops.  If a T-72 does not have reactive armour upgrade, anti-tank RPG can knock it out. At the end of the day if the BH has 500 rounds per man, and the NA has 120 rounds per man, after 30 minutes standoff turns to slaughter, pure and simple. The only saviour would have been minimizing ammo (like civil war Owerri siege) and hunkering until backup/air support arrives.

 It's terribly unfair to refer to our troops as cowards, bearing in mind they must obey orders. What is clear is that BH has changed tactics and NA has not, leading to increasing casualties and losses for us. NA wants to fight BH using conventional tactics and heavy weapons ill-suited for northeastern/sahel terrain. Even if they wanted to, it will be suicidal to take the fight to BH using current methods and hardware.

 Easy for you to say from far off. Most of the commanders i've met in NE are NOT from the North; I find this intriguing and disturbing at the same time. This war, you need street cred and local intel like yesterday, you need to get the locals to trust you. As it stands, BH, using terror and coercion, largely have the edge over our boots on the ground. And lest we forget, military high command is feeding fat off this war and don't give a damn about rank and file.

  It really annoys me when I read about this matale attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  How can a battalion, commanded by a whole Lt Col, with a population of over four hundred soldiers  be overrun by Bh after getting an hour Intel before the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Let's assume they didn't have enough ammo. One hour is enough to plan a resistance strategy and an escape strategy in case they run out of ammunition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said they were trapped by the barb wires and trenches around the base. They could have created a secret route before hand so that when they are outgunned, they will have an easy way out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But what happened, scout came and said "oga, the boys are coming oo" oga replied, "go and tell your men to prepare for battle" and they waited for BHT to bring the war to them while they were on the defensive. After exhausting their ammo, they decided to marte and BHT took advantage and finished them up. even heard bht sent a letter weeks before the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A creative army is not one with the best weapon but one that can make use of minimum resources to achieve maximum impact. Unfortunately, our soldiers were not creative, their superiors in Abuja failed them, the government failed them and they died for nothing.
 </blockquote>
 <br/>
 Ive made the point on several threads on the Metele attack. A major problem is training and orientation. The attack was most unfortunate as it was a national embarrassment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 That BH in just Toyota Hilux vans, motor bike, ak47s and a few RPGs could annihilate over 100 soldiers after less than an hour of fight, EVEN WITH ADVANCE WARNING, shows the very poor and pitiable state of the NA.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They keep shouting lack of weapons, but according to the report by PT, BH carted away large cache of weapons from the base. So where did it come from?
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Of course the buck stops with the guys in Abuja, right from Burutai to PMB. We don't have an army

 I don't believe this.

 They got an hour heads up and those killed in the video we watched were not wearing battle gears.
 <br/>
 They had at least one T 71 tank in that base and if it had coughed on the insurgents twice, they would all be dead.

 Finally, if they ran out of arms, which weapons were in the armoury for the insurgents to loot?

  One of the soldiers who escaped the deadly attack on the military formation in Metele in Borno state has narrated how he escaped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 100 soldiers attached to 157 task force battalion were reportedly killed in the attack while the armoury at the formation was looted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) had claimed responsibility for the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier who spoke off the record said more than 100 of his colleagues fled the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier accused the military authorities of lying to the public about the insurgency in the north-east, calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Most of our people dropped their arms and pulled off this dirty uniform… the bodies of our troops littered everywhere but we watched the news and heard army headquarters saying troops repelled the attack,” he told TheCable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The army chief and other generals only sit in Abuja and lie to Nigerians whereas soldiers are being killed on daily basis. We lack manpower but nobody is telling the president the truth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The president should demand the whereabouts of all the soldiers deployed to Operation Last Hold to fight Boko Haram under Major General Abbah Dikko. The answer is, all of them have been crushed by Boko Haram and their new weapons and arms are what the Boko Haram is using to attack us. Please, help us tell Mr President that the service chiefs are just lying to him.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another soldier said he and his colleagues engaged the insurgents in a gun battle for 40 minutes but they eventually ran out of ammunition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said troops at the formation were alerted about the attack, one hour before the insurgents struck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sakaba told us to prepare for battle after being briefed by one of our soldiers whose duty is to monitor what is coming from distance,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We engaged the terrorists for over 40 minutes before we ran out of ammunition on that very Sunday. They were well equipped and armed with rocket propelled grenades, more than 12 gun trucks mounted with anti-air craft shooting at us from a long range,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Some of us ran out of bullets and they overpowered us, we fled but those who could not escape were slaughtered like chicken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My brother our formation is surrounded by big trenches and barbed wires, which became a trap for our made it difficult for them to escape. I watched many of my fellow friends died helplessly in cold blood.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another soldier who wants to be identified at Gods child, said it was a miracle that they survived the onslaught.

 Those weapons bokoharam are using are newly purchased with ransom mone paid by buhari.Nigeria can afford it but the $1billion budget for arms to fight bokoharam whom lie Mohamed said have been technically defeated have been diverted for his second term election campaign.While buratai and his colleague generals have diverted the rest.

The soldiers are shouting that their weapons are outdated/substandard and cannot match those of BH. If we cannot get an immediate answer to this question and nobody's head rolls, PMB should just release and apologize to Dasuki.

 It really annoys me when I read about this matale attack.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 How can a battalion, commanded by a whole Lt Col, with a population of over four hundred soldiers  be overrun by Bh after getting an hour Intel before the attack.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Let's assume they didn't have enough ammo. One hour is enough to plan a resistance strategy and an escape strategy in case they run out of ammunition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They said they were trapped by the barb wires and trenches around the base. They could have created a secret route before hand so that when they are outgunned, they will have an easy way out.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But what happened, scout came and said "oga, the boys are coming oo" oga replied, "go and tell your men to prepare for battle" and they waited for BHT to bring the war to them while they were on the defensive. After exhausting their ammo, they decided to marte and BHT took advantage and finished them up. even heard bht sent a letter weeks before the attack.
 <br/>

What is it with this two foolish foolani men?

  It really annoys me when I read about this matale attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  How can a battalion, commanded by a whole Lt Col, with a population of over four hundred soldiers  be overrun by Bh after getting an hour Intel before the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Let's assume they didn't have enough ammo. One hour is enough to plan a resistance strategy and an escape strategy in case they run out of ammunition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said they were trapped by the barb wires and trenches around the base. They could have created a secret route before hand so that when they are outgunned, they will have an easy way out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But what happened, scout came and said "oga, the boys are coming oo" oga replied, "go and tell your men to prepare for battle" and they waited for BHT to bring the war to them while they were on the defensive. After exhausting their ammo, they decided to marte and BHT took advantage and finished them up. even heard bht sent a letter weeks before the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A creative army is not one with the best weapon but one that can make use of minimum resources to achieve maximum impact. Unfortunately, our soldiers were not creative, their superiors in Abuja failed them, the government failed them and they died for nothing.

 That is the problem with Nigerian army. Many of the senior officers at the rank of brigadier generals down know nothing about real warfare. They are only experienced in suppressing social disorder by shooting canisters of tear gas and the regular aim and shoot. War is more abou technique than weapon. Normally, an officer at the rank of Lt Col should be a wizard in the art of warfare but many of those we have now are ajebutters without any battle experience. This is why there was so much casualty.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 I remember one of our family friends. he was an old corporal in the army. He was telling us how a platoon commander who is a captain almost landed them into an ambush. at that point he had to shout at the small boy and took over command. in the end they were able to prevail. he said if he didnt go against the captain, he won't be telling the story today. Most of our commissioned officers are lazy and incompetent, they only know how to show force and chase women upandan

 Let's not get too excited. advance warning was from the lookout in the watchtower, not some street level intel. that means by the time that warning came, the battalion was already surrounded, the BH advance was already in progress, they just delayed opening fire by an hour, probably to mess up the mind and morale of the troops.  If a T-72 does not have reactive armour upgrade, anti-tank RPG can knock it out. At the end of the day if the BH has 500 rounds per man, and the NA has 120 rounds per man, after 30 minutes standoff turns to slaughter, pure and simple.

What is clear is that BH has changed tactics and NA has not, leading to increasing casualties and losses for us. NA wants to fight BH using conventional tactics and heavy weapons ill-suited for northeastern/sahel terrain. Even if they wanted to, it will be suicidal to take the fight to BH using current methods and hardware.

 To even say that is an embarrassment.  It's rather to give beneath of a doubt that you survived because of bravery instead of exposing that you're a coward.  Reasons why I have no respect for Nigeria army. If it's civilians now, they do operation crocodile smile but, if it's Boko Haram, they'll run. Shame!

  If I'd been in Borno, i'd've been commander and I'd never have been outwitted by no ape-brained Bokoharam scum-bag. I'm an individual that trusts no one and always anticipate situations. Problem with Nigerians is that they have beautiful trusting minds,which is often overlooked because of their overblown reputation for criminality. Nigerians are guileless.

 Easy for you to say from far off. Most of the commanders i've met in NE are NOT from the North; I find this intriguing and disturbing at the same time. This war, you need street cred and local intel like yesterday, you need to get the locals to trust you. As it stands, BH, using terror and coercion, largely have the edge over our boots on the ground. And lest we forget, military high command is feeding fat off this war and don't give a damn about rank and file.

  A place were 100 soldiers died the least we expect is a thousand terrorist dead bodies , but look at the score NA lost 100 men , BH lost less than ten. isn't this flawless
  <img src="/faces/huh.png" style="width:15px;height:22px;"/>
  . this shows how pathetic our soldiers are when it comes to training, this Ajebo soldier is complaining about "not well equipped" , is it not the same weapons that the NA are running and leaving behind that the BH are using ?, if u have a running mind u will run even if your body is covered with bullet proof from head to toe. but a brave soldiers will fight even without gun, there is knife and there is combat training also. A brave soldier will rather die honourably than to die running away. Please let them know being a soldier is a sacrifice not an enjoying job.

  It really annoys me when I read about this matale attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  How can a battalion, commanded by a whole Lt Col, with a population of over four hundred soldiers  be overrun by Bh after getting an hour Intel before the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Let's assume they didn't have enough ammo. One hour is enough to plan a resistance strategy and an escape strategy in case they run out of ammunition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said they were trapped by the barb wires and trenches around the base. They could have created a secret route before hand so that when they are outgunned, they will have an easy way out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But what happened, scout came and said "oga, the boys are coming oo" oga replied, "go and tell your men to prepare for battle" and they waited for BHT to bring the war to them while they were on the defensive. After exhausting their ammo, they decided to marte and BHT took advantage and finished them up. even heard bht sent a letter weeks before the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A creative army is not one with the best weapon but one that can make use of minimum resources to achieve maximum impact. Unfortunately, our soldiers were not creative, their superiors in Abuja failed them, the government failed them and they died for nothing.
 </blockquote>
 <br/>
 Ive made the point on several threads on the Metele attack. A major problem is training and orientation. The attack was most unfortunate as it was a national embarrassment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 That BH in just Toyota Hilux vans, motor bike, ak47s and a few RPGs could annihilate over 100 soldiers after less than an hour of fight, EVEN WITH ADVANCE WARNING, shows the very poor and pitiable state of the NA.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They keep shouting lack of weapons, but according to the report by PT, BH carted away large cache of weapons from the base. So where did it come from?
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Of course the buck stops with the guys in Abuja, right from Burutai to PMB. We don't have an army

 They were aware of the impending attack and waited for it to come at them. I wonder what kind of training their commander had. Should have called in for air force to launch strikes. The army is a joke. Top generals got blood on their hand.

 I don't believe this.
 <br/>
 They got an hour heads up and those killed in the video we watched were not wearing battle gears.
 <br/>
 They had at least one T 71 tank in that base and if it had coughed on the insurgents twice, they would all be dead.
 <br/>
 Finally, if they ran out of arms, which weapons were in the armoury for the insurgents to loot?

 See what a Nigeria soldier is saying out of his mouth, we soldier are been killed every day. At first what is primary assignment of the Nigeria soldiers. A Nigeria soldier well trained for years will be there an ordinary civilian will come and kill him. That is say that the Nigeria soldiers are no longer ready to protect Nigerians.

  That is the problem with Nigerian army. Many of the senior officers at the rank of brigadier generals down know nothing about real warfare. They are only experienced in suppressing social disorder by shooting canisters of tear gas and the regular aim and shoot. War is more abou technique than weapon. Normally, an officer at the rank of Lt Col should be a wizard in the art of warfare but many of those we have now are ajebutters without any battle experience. This is why there was so much casualty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I remember one of our family friends. he was an old corporal in the army. He was telling us how a platoon commander who is a captain almost landed them into an ambush. at that point he had to shout at the small boy and took over command. in the end they were able to prevail. he said if he didnt go against the captain, he won't be telling the story today. Most of our commissioned officers are lazy and incompetent, they only know how to show force and chase women upandan
  <br/>
 </blockquote>
 <br/>
 You see, the case of corporal and captain you mentioned reminds me of the situation in Vietnam.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The American officers at that time were young and fresh graduates of the military academy at west point without any real battle experience. It resulted in friction between the officers and the veteran grunts (corporals, sergeant et all) who felt that the young officers were novices in battle and were leading them astray.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This cost them the war. At the end of the Vietnam war, the US armed forces chiefs reviewed the situation and observes that most newly commissioned officers haven't tasted battle and had no experience. What they were been taught in the academy didn't mirror real battle conditions and such newly commissioned officers were ill-prepared for realities of warfare. This contributed to the huge no of casualties experienced by the Americans.
 <br/>

 I'm sure the same thing is playing out in the Nigerian army against terrorists

 <br/>
 Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
 <br/>
 “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
 <br/>
 “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

  Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
  <br/>
  “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
  <br/>
  “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

  I swear if Hazard can just learn to pass or cross the ball after one or two touches, Chelsea strikers will probably score more... he will hold ball and begin to caress it like Mike and his sex doll!

 If by bad man management you're talking about Costa's case, then you're clearly wrong on that.

 Diego was trying to get back Player power that dominated the dressing room during the J. Terry's era. Either way Costa had to leave.

 Tactical flexibility when you have a bunch of stiff players who can't do nothing when switched on opposite wings?

 I had an argument here before about how Conte was not given ultimate decision over players he wanted.

  Conte is a good coach but he has seniors. Every other thing you said here is hot garbage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Conte took over a Juve team that had finished 7th twice before he came. They were not a relegated team. Not even close.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is a pragmatic defensive coach which is why Mou kept throwing shade that CFC should not be celebrating him for winning defensively when he, Mou, was criticised for doing same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Conte was known for packing draws. His first league season was heavily dependent on drawing games whereas Pep is known for crushing opposing teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Conte left Juve, they have faired better. Same cannot be said about Barca.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pressure in Barca is the most- making it the most difficult job in the world because you must win by playing exquisitely. It is for this reason Mou was not hired when he begged for the job in 08.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City team best placed?

  North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has bragged that his country has achieved full nuclear statehood after successfully testing a new missile capable of hitting virtually anywhere in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country ended a 10-week pause in its weapons testing on Tuesday when it fired off a Hwasong-15 rocket - its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile yet which the regime claimed could be fitted with a 'super heavy nuclear warhead'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It poses a new challenge for President Donald Trump who has vowed not to let North Korea develop nuclear missiles that can hit the US mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After watching the launch, Kim Jong-un boasted about its success, according to state television presenter Ri Chun-Hee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'Kim Jong-un declared with pride that now we have finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force, the cause of building a rocket power,' the presenter said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'The great success in the test-fire of ICBM Hwasong-15 is a priceless victory won by the great and heroic people of the DPRK,' she added, using the abbreviated name for North Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis warned on Tuesday that North Korea now has the ability to hit 'everywhere in the world' and that the latest missile test went 'higher, frankly, than any previous shot they have taken.'

 Once you get the 5th yellow card, it's official you'll miss a game.

  strength is very important for a striker.
  <br/>
  First off. I'm a huge morata fan, i was very dissapointed and still am that he left madrid I'm not really a fan of chelsea but i sometimes watch chelsea games coz of morata.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Morata sometimes struggles to remain on his feet. If he  can improve that about him, he just needs a few more tweaks and then he is the finished version.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lukaku can stay on his feet regardless of the strength of the opponent.  He can hold/guard the ball and wait for his teammate the pass. There were scenarios he did that in his most recent game against newcastle. That strength is very important because he can also use it to bully defenders and move through them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That strength was also visible as he ferociously smashed his goal against newcastle. Even if the goalkeeper got a hand on it, i doubt he could prevent it from going in
 </blockquote>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yes, Morata needs to work on his strength so as Lukaku needs to work on his header, link up play, and his big mouth off the pitch too.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Did you watch Ruud boy at Man United or Bergkamp at Arsenal? Strength weren't their biggest asset yet they wrote their names in the history books.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 As a player you can't have everything, there are bound to be weaknesses. They're both doing well for their clubs and that should be enough.

  Professor Canavero, director of the Turin Advanced Neuromodulation Group, made the announcement at a press conference in Vienna this morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The procedure was carried out by a team led by Dr Xiaoping Ren, who last year grafted a head onto the body of a monkey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A full report of the Harbin Medical University team's procedure and a timeframe for the live transplant are expected within the next few days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the press conference, Professor Canavero said: 'For too long nature has dictated her rules to us.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'We're born, we grow, we age and we die. For millions of years humans has evolved and 110 billion humans have died in the process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'That's genocide on a mass scale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'We have entered an age where we will take our destiny back in our hands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'It will change everything. It will change you at every level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'The first human head transplant, in the human mode, has been realised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'The surgery lasted 18 hours. The paper will be released in a few days.'
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'Everyone said it was impossible, but the surgery was successful.'
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Canavero added that the team's next step is to perform a full head swap between brain dead organ donors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And that is the final step for the formal head transplant for a medical condition which is imminent,' he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'It will be for a medical, neurological condition, not for life-extension.'
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked whether the eventual plans for live procedures would go worldwide after initial tests in China, Professor Canavero said: 'Given the amount of mean criticism we recieved I don't think we should go international.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'For instance, if you still stick to the Frankenstein schtick, which doesn't make sense, then no.

  PREPARATION FOR THE PROCEDURE
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May, scientists carried out a head transplant on a rat in a practise run for controversial human experiment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers used three rats for each operation: a smaller rat, to be the donor, and two larger rats, acting as the recipient and the blood supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To maintain blood flow to the donor brain, they connected the blood vessels from that rat to veins of the third rat using a silicon tube, which was then passed through a peristaltic pump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then, once the head had been transplanted onto the second rat's body, the researchers used vascular grafts to connect the donor's thoracic aorta and superior vena cava to the carotid artery and extracorporeal veins of the recipient.

Many of them are so snubbish and ill mannered, they talk to you as if ''your a magaa''... Somma them even think with what they have they can make guys go crazy, I wonder what is that but I will soon find out...those I found more irritating is those that call themselves ''slay queens'' mehn these typa Girls Hot sha but they irritating to me.... What more can I say, lastly the silent mamma's that don't have Guys time, they won't talk to u even u talk to them., when u say Hi their next reaction is one kind bad look to u,some go extramile hissing... I go slap this kind Girl oneday.... Anyway what can u say about this then.....I don give up on Girls for Now.....,...I don go break abeg, the girls don tire me with there wahala.......

  The Nigerian banking space is fiercely competitive; only the fittest survive. Maintaining the minimum capital base means adopting aggressive marketing techniques and a cutting edge corporate culture. The pressure this goal places on bank workers makes banking one of the least enviable professions in Nigeria today. Below are some of things that Nigerian bankers hate about their jobs...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1.	Perennial late closing hours

  2.	Being engaged on a contract basis and earning far less than other permanent staff

Many of them are so snubbish and ill mannered, they talk to you as if ''your a magaa''... Somma them even think with what they have they can make guys go crazy, I wonder what is that but I will soon find out...those I found more irritating is those that call themselves ''slay queens'' mehn these typa Girls Hot sha but they irritating to me.... What more can I say, lastly the silent mamma's that don't have Guys time, they won't talk to u even u talk to them., when u say Hi their next reaction is one kind bad look to u,some go extramile hissing... I go slap this kind Girl oneday.... Anyway what can u say about this then.....I don give up on Girls for Now.....,...I don go break abeg, the girls don tire me with there wahala.......

 Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in
 <br/>
 such a way that will enable pre - primary school pupils to learn software development and coding .
 <br/>
 Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel
 <br/>
 Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
 <br/>
 Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
 <br/>
 Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
 <br/>
 “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
 <br/>
 “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”

He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.

  Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said that the Federal Government will change the educational curriculum in
  <br/>
  such a way that will enable pre - primary school pupils to learn software development and coding .
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said this during the 50th National Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Personnel
  <br/>
  Management of Nigeria held in Abuja recently.
  <br/>
  Speaking at the event with the theme, ‘Stand Out ’, the Vice President said that many countries across the world had begun to shift focus from natural to human resources development . He said that any youth , who lacked Information and Communication Technology skills and knowledge , would become unemployable in the future , stressing that this had informed the Federal Government ’s decision to infuse educational development in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.
  <br/>
  Osinbajo said, “ The focus on primary and secondary education is on employability skills, especially technology. So our focus is on teaching young people from the primary, even pre- primary , school to use all the new techniques, especially code writing skills and software writing skills.
  <br/>
  “ The new technologies that are developing everything we are seeing today clearly show that anyone in the coming generation will be left behind, if they are not equipped with the knowledge of cutting edge of technology or with a sound knowledge of technology , at least. We believe that our educational system must incorporate that , which is why , with the new curriculum , a lot of attention is focused on science , technology , engineering and mathematics.”
  <br/>
  “ For a country like Nigeria , which is highly dependent on oil, we need to remind our people that oil is a depleting asset. The country ’ s large population, especially our young ones, is where its strength truly lies .”
