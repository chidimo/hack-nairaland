According to him, while no narrative is superior enough to displace the nation�s corporate existence, agitations are largely self-serving rather than altruistic.</blockquote>So the politicians who are looting us into poverty are the altruistic ones.

�We must do something about it, we must control it and we must insist that it is not acceptable. Public discourse of any type that is already on the social media, we cannot allow the promotion of it�</blockquote>Isn't that what your govt cares about? Control, control and more control. Instead of focusing on bettering people's lives you want to gag them. To stop them from venting their frustration.

�The witnesses of the horrors of war will not wish it on their worst enemies. Even recalling it may bring back the trauma of that period. The mental and physical scars of war are sometimes so deep that rational thought of something is impugned. But always, hate speech precedes genocide, the greatest tragedy in human history� </blockquote>Of course you always want to threaten the people so that they don't revolt against you. You want to make a difference? Fix the country. You know what to do but too selfish to do it.

These calls for division are not good for our democracy</blockquote>Of course they are not good for business as usual. So we understand your complaint.

On his part, the director general of the DSS, Lawal Daura, vowed to deal with individuals and groups that threaten the inviolability and sanctity of the Nigerian state.</blockquote>So when are you going to arrest the Arewa youth leaders? What about Nnamdi Kanu that has flagrantly violated his bail conditions?

Sanctity of Nigerian state ke. Nigeria is not made in heaven. It was created by Britain and it can be unmade. Nigeria is not sacred. Stop using words any how.

His words: �In recent times, centrifugal forces have been at work in our great nation, trying their utmost to pull us apart. They have vainly leveraged on our ethnic, geographical and religious cleavages- the key factors that constitute our very rich tapestry of cultural treasure and diversity- to ignite hate speeches and stoke ethnic cum religious tensions nationwide.</blockquote>Not true sir. They have leveraged the frustration you people have imposed on Nigerians. Not that truth matters to you anyway.

Who even believes a word of what you guys say? None

Nigerians complain a lot.

You get a job and you don't like the offer you quit!

Why trouble yourself with outsource and no outsource after years of sitting at home unemployed.

The country is bad make do with what you have and make other plans for the future.

Do you plan on working your entire life for a boss? F**k NO!

Make do with what you have now that you're still young instead of whining like an entitled spoilt brat and chart your way to success.

Stay here and complain while others are already planning ahead.

Nigerians complaint too much. </blockquote>

Don’t mind some of them.

If you go in as a contractor and prove yourself then you may get picked up.

As an employer, why would I waste resources to board and then have to fire an employee that didn’t work out.
